    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am Junguang Jiang. I graduated from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Mingsheng Long. 
      Now, I work as a machine learning engineer in the display advertising team at Alimama.

      I created a Transfer Learning Library
      <a href="https://github.com/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library">TLlib</a>
      and got over <img alt="GitHub stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library?style=social">.
      
      Here is my <a href="https://junguangjiang.github.io/files/resume.pdf">Chinese resume (中文简历)</a> and <a href="https://junguangjiang.github.io/files/resume_English.pdf">English resume</a>.
